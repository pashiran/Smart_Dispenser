Smart Dispenser for MAKERS

When you're building electronic circuits, some tools are so industrial that they're rarely useful for personal use. 
Instead of a giant pneumatic dispenser that sits on your desk, I created a USB-powered dispenser that fits in the palm of your hand. 

It took me a lot of time to build the hardware, electronics, and software all by myself. 
I'm not a professional programmer, so the software is waiting for other people to make it better.
